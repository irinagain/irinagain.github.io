## Structured Research Experience (SRE) in Statistics


The SRE in Statistics program is coordinated by Dr. Gaynanova, and is
designed to prepare students for conducting more traditional statistical
research with faculty, as well as improve students’ communication and
programming skills.  The program is more similar to classroom-like
experience than traditional research, with regular group meetings,
assigned readings and research task deadlines. Through the program, each
student will complete an entry research project focused on design and
reproducibility of simulation studies, going through the full research
cycle from reading the literature to writing a final report. The students participate in the program for the duration of one semester.

This summer program will provide funding for 3 students to participate in SRE and assiste in its development.
At the successful completion of this program, each student participant will be awarded $1500. Students should expect to work an estimated 10 hours/week for about 10 weeks of the summer.
