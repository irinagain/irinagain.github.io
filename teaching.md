Dr. Gaynanovaâ€™s teaching methods emphasize reproducible research practices, statistical computing and communication skills; her goal being to prepare students for STEM-oriented careers. Her teaching has been recognized with a Cornelia Ye Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award at Cornell University, she also serves as a faculty mentor in the Academy for Future Faculty at Texas A&M University.
