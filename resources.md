 **On Writing**
 
Any brilliant idea can be killed by horrible writing (or so I've been told by some journal editors). Fortunately, good writing can be learned and there are numeruous resources out there to help. If you are a TAMU student, then you may want to consult
 - [University Writing Center](http://writingcenter.tamu.edu)
 - [POWER Writing Services](http://power.tamu.edu)
 
If you would like to read a book, then personally I found the following most useful:
 - [The Elements of Stile, Strunk and White](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1505700931&sr=1-1&keywords=strunk+and+white)(for grammar and style)
 - [How to Write a Lot, Paul Silva](https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Lot-Practical-Productive/dp/1591477433) (for motivation and persistence)
 - [Becoming an Academic Writer, Patricia Goodson](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Academic-Writer-Exercises-Productive/dp/1452203865)(for exercises to improve, and specific sections advice)
 
 Some of the advices in these books are specific to Psychology, but the majority carries through to pretty much any subject.
 
 **On R**
 
  - Style guides (how to format your code) from [H. Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) and from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml). Also see [formatR](https://yihui.name/formatr/) R package for automatic reformatting of code.
 
 

**On Git and Github**

Version Control is imperative to keeping track of changes in the code. Git is a very popular version control system, and can be easily used with RStudio. [Github](https://github.com) is a website that provides powerful integration with Git, and allows easy sharing of the code with others. 
 - [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) is a nice intro by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz) including RStudio integration
 - [here](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html) is a short guide from [Udacity](http://blog.udacity.com) with links for futher reading

**On Academic Job Market (candidate's perspectie)**

Here is a [link to my perspective/advice on the academic job market](http://stat.tamu.edu/~irinag/Advice/AcademicJobMarketAdviceIrina.pdf) based on my experience as a candidate in year 2014/2015. It has been strongly inspired by a [similar document](http://pages.iu.edu/~dajmcdon/usefullinks/marketadvice.pdf) from [Daniel McDonald](http://pages.iu.edu/~dajmcdon/), which was very helpful when I applied.
