My research focuses on the development of statistical methods for analysis of modern high-dimensional biomedical data, and is at the intersection of applied, computational and theoretical statistics.
I believe that challenging applied problems give rise to better statistical methodology and my primary goal is to aid the discovery of scientifically meaningful low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional data. I believe that collaboration plays a key role in achieving this goal and I enjoy working with both domain scientists and methodological researchers. My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation and recognized with a David P. Byar Young Investigator Award from the Biometrics section of the American Statistical Association.

**Summary of methodological interests:**

* high-dimensional data analysis (with the focus on sparsity regularization)
* multivariate analysis (dimension reduction methods such as PCA, CCA and LDA)
* data integration/multi-view data analysis
* statistical/machine learning
* computational statistics

**Summary of application interests:**

* multi-omics data analysis (e.g. gene expression, methylation, miRNA, etc.)
* microbiome data 
* data from wearable devices (e.g. [continuous glucose monitors](https://irinagain.github.io/CGM/) and activity trackers)

<!-- Her main methodological interests are in the areas of statistical learning with sparsity, multivariate analysis and data integration. Her main application interests are in the analysis of multi-omics data and data from wearable devices, such as continuous glucose monitors and activity trackers. 

 My methodological interests are in the areas of multivariate analysis, machine learning and computational statistics. The classical multivariate analysis tools, which can be used for the analysis of variance (principal components), classification (discriminant analysis) or network recovery (canonical correlation), perform poorly when applied to modern datasets due to the presence of spurious correlations and over-selection of relevant features. I am interested in addressing these problems jointly in the high-dimensional settings by developing new statistical methodology that is both computationally efficient and theoretically sound. I have found that penalization techniques and the tools of convex optimization are particularly useful in achieving this goal.

 I have worked on a variety of applied problems such as classification of leukemia patients based on DNA methylation profiles, control of false discovery rates in sample size calculations and study of antibiotic molecular actions based on the metabolic profiles. My methodological work has been strongly motivated by these applied projects and I am looking forward to new collaborations in the future.
